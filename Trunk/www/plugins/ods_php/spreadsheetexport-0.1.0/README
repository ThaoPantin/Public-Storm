SpreadsheetExport is PHP class which allows you to export data in table style
as "OpenDocument Spreadsheet" (.ods) or "Comma Separated Values" (.csv). The 
configuration and data settings are the same for both opportunities, so you only
have to code the data providing algorithm once and then can simply choose the
file format.

download either as ODS or as CSV file.
